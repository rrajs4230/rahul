//package com.selenium;
//// Define the VoiceControl interface
//interface VoiceControl {
//    void activateVoiceControl();
//}
//
//// Define the WebDriver interface
//interface WebDriver {
//    void navigateTo(String url);
//    void click(String element);
//}
//
//// Define the ChromeDriver class, which implements the WebDriver interface
//class ChromeDriver implements WebDriver {
//    public void navigateTo(String url) {
//        // Code to navigate to the specified URL in Chrome browser
//    }
//    
//    public void click(String element) {
//        // Code to click on the specified element in Chrome browser
//    }
//}
//
//// Now, let's say we want to add the VoiceControl feature to our ChromeDriver.
//// We can do this by implementing the VoiceControl interface in the ChromeDriver class:
//
//class ChromeDriver implements WebDriver, VoiceControl {
//    public void navigateTo(String url) {
//        // Code to navigate to the specified URL in Chrome browser
//    }
//    
//    public void click(String element) {
//        // Code to click on the specified element in Chrome browser
//    }
//    
//    public void activateVoiceControl() {
//        // Code to activate the voice control feature in Chrome browser
//    }
//}
//
//// Finally, let's say we want to use the VoiceControl feature with our ChromeDriver object.
//// We can do this by casting the ChromeDriver object to the VoiceControl interface:
//
//ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
//VoiceControl vc = (VoiceControl) driver;
//vc.activateVoiceControl();



/*The reason we need to do typecasting from WebDriver to JavascriptExecutor in this case is because the executeScript method is not defined in the WebDriver interface. It is only defined in the JavascriptExecutor interface.

When we create a ChromeDriver object and assign it to a WebDriver reference, we are essentially limiting ourselves to only the methods defined in the WebDriver interface. However, we know that the ChromeDriver class also implements the JavascriptExecutor interface, which means it has the executeScript method.

By casting the WebDriver object to a JavascriptExecutor object, we can access the executeScript method and use it to execute JavaScript commands in the browser.





User
so chromedriver execute both method in same instance right
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. When you create a ChromeDriver object, you are creating an instance of the ChromeDriver class which implements both the WebDriver and JavascriptExecutor interfaces. This means that you can use the WebDriver methods to interact with the web page and navigate around, and you can also use the JavascriptExecutor methods to execute JavaScript code within the browser.

So when you write WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); and then cast the driver object to a JavascriptExecutor using JavascriptExecutor exe = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;, you are essentially using the same instance of the ChromeDriver object to access both sets of methods.*/
